It allows us to analyze various aspects of the occurrence of fires in our study area during the selected time period. One of this aspects is that there were extended periods with few or no fires, as well as periods with a higher frequency. Additionally, not all periods had the same number of detected hotspots, with some having a higher frequency of fires than others. Between these periods there where two notable periods with a high frequency of fires are the peaks in 2020 and 2021. Other interesting peaks occurred in 2012, 2013 and 2018. </p><p class="has-small-font-size">To continue with the analysis, let’s take a closer look at the three years with the highest frequency of fires (years with the highest peaks). Because of the irregular distribution of fires throughout the year, as shown in the plot, it’s challenging to identify if 2012, 2013 or 2018 had the highest number of fires. To address this, we can further our analysis with a bar plot that shows the total number of hotspots detected by year.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/20.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="413" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/21.jpg" alt="" width="767" height="430" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>The latest bar plot provides us further insight into the interpretation of the first plot. Since each bar shows the total detected hotspots for a given year, regardless of at which month it occurred, it’s easier to identify which years had the highest frequency of fires. However, this plot doesn’t definitively identify the year with the third highest frequency of fires, apart from 2020 and 2021. To clarify this, we can delve deeper into the dataframe used to create the bar plot.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/22.jpg" alt="" width="764" height="94" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/23.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="214" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Finally, after analyzing the dataframe shown above, we can confirm that the three top years with the highest number of detected hotspots were 2018, 2020 and 2021.

Firstly, it’s worth noting that the month with the highest number of fires detected in all three years was the month number 08, August. This reinforces what we already knew about our study area, that fires tend to occur towards the end of winter. Secondly, it’s also interesting to observe that the total number of fires in 2020 was much higher than in the other years with, for example, a 1:10 ratio for August 2018. Thirdly, unlike what happened in 2018 and 2020, the fire activity in 2021 in the study area was relatively constant throughout the year. Lastly, after reviewing the tables for the top five days with the highest number of detected hotspots, it becomes evident that most of the days fell in the period within the last 10 days of August.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Analysis of spatial distribution of fires</h4><p class="has-small-font-size">Now, we can leverage the full potential of our georeferenced dataset to create more interesting plots. Building upon our previous analysis, where we identified the years, months, and specific days with the highest number of detected hotspots, let’s explore the spatial distribution of these hotspots in our study area. </p><p class="has-small-font-size">To begin, we will plot all the hotspots detected during the top three years with the highest occurrences of fires separetely. This will provide us with a visual representation of the geographic spread of these fires.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/28.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="512" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/29.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="402" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">These plots provide us insights into the spatial distribution of the fires detected during the chosen years. Despite being the top three years, the number of detected hotspots varies among them, which is evident in the plots shown before. In 2018, the fires were dispersed throughout the study area, with a higher concentration in the upper region. In 2020, the fires occurred in almost every part of the River Parana Delta, but the density was relatively lower in the bottom section. In 2021, we can observe a higher density on the middle and lower regions, with a concentrated area of maximum intensity. </p><p class="has-small-font-size">While the previous plots show us the overall spatial distribution of fires throughout the year, it is important to note that the fire occurrence in the study area is not uniform. As we discovered earlier, the peak of hotspot detection for all three years falls in August, the month number eight. Now, let’s explore deeper into the spatial distribution by analyzing the number of fires detected before and after August, including August itself.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/30.jpg" alt="" width="767" height="709" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/31.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="375" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-xs.webp 300w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-sm.webp 480w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-md.webp 768w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-lg.webp 1024w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-xl.webp 1360w, https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p class="has-small-font-size">As we discussed before, the fires occur towards the end of the winter to facilitate grass regrowth for pasture. The preceding plots confirm this and provide some extra valuable insights for our analysis. According to the plots, in 2018 and 2020 the highest number of fires occurred during months 8 to 12. However, there were differences in their distribution pattern. On the other hand, for 2021 we can observe that fires in months 1-7 were significantly important, almost equaling the ones that occurred in months 7-12. This supports what we observed in the bar plot made before for this year.</p><p class="has-small-font-size">To conclude our analysis, we can incorporate an additional visualization. We will examine the distribution of hotspots detected during the last ten days of August in 2018, 2020 and 2021.

For example, one might expect to find a similarity in the locations where the fires occurred, with a superposition of all the detected hotspots. This was not the case for the years and the period chosen. However, what becomes evident is that each year exhibits distinct clusters of fires of different sizes, which may have originated from independent initial fire sources and subsequently expanded.</p><p class="has-small-font-size">After this final analysis, one question arises: what factors contributed to this particular behavior during the days identified as the ones with the highest number of fires?

In the first part we did a preliminary processing and extracted the relevant data of interest. In the second part we conducted an additional processing to visualize the dataset obtained in the <a href="https://opensourcegisdata.com/analysis-of-fires-parana-river-delta-argentina-using-viirs-part-1.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>first part</strong></span></a>. This enabled us to gain valuable insights into the occurrence of fires in the Parana River delta and address different questions about this, while also uncovering new ones. </p><p class="has-small-font-size">One of the questions addressed in this post pertains to the identification of the three years, from 2012 to 2021, with the highest number of detected fires. Additionally, we explored the temporal distribution of the fires throughout the year for these specific years. Then, through further processing and analysis, we were able to identify the exact day with the highest number of fires during the aforementioned time period. </p><p class="has-small-font-size">Another significant aspect of this analysis involved the spatial distribution of fires. We examined how the detected fires were spatially distributed during the three years with the highest number of occurrences. This allowed us to observe similarities and differences among these years.</p><p class="has-small-font-size">Finally, one question arose: What factors caused the initial location of the fire clusters found in August for 2018, 2020 and 2021? Was it solely due to anthropogenic causes? Were the weather conditions or the hydrology?  Or was it a combination of all of these factors? These questions will be explored in future posts.</p><h2>Sources</h2><p>Salvia, M. M. (2010).
