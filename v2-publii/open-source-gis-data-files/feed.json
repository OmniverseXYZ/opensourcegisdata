It's one of the top ten downloaded plugins and consistently gets high usage. It provides some capabilities that are not readily available in the Processing toolbox. </p>\n<h4>Features of MMQGIS</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>MMQGIS Plugin</strong></a> contains seven toolsets that add core functionality. Each one comes with a set of tools to help you get the most usage out of QGIS.</p>\n<h5>Animate</h5>\n<p>It allows you to create frames so you can build simple animations in QGIS. The tool plots successive rows in a layer – or more than a single layer. This is an exemplary visualization common for showing vectors in a flow map such as the direction of goods traveled.</p>\n<h5>Geocode</h5>\n<p>The geocoding tools in MMQGIS are a major part of the reason why this plugin gets so many downloads. Turn your addresses into geocoded points. Or vice versa, you can convert your current point file into addresses.</p>\n<h5>Import/Export</h5>\n<p>These tools are designed for simple conversion between a few selected formats. Either you can work with CSV or KML giving functionality to import and export.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Export attributes or geometry to CSV</li>\n<li>Import geometry from CSV</li>\n<li>Google Maps KML export</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Modify</h5>\n<p>These tools are for modifying your existing data through geometry updates, field changes, or projecting features. You can also locate duplicate geometry or simplify features by aligning vertices to a grid.</p>\n<h5>Combine</h5>\n<p>This tool gives you a day of tools for integrating more than one dataset. Here are some of the algorithms that are a part of this toolset. Join attributes from CSV layer Merge layers to create a new output Spatial join that joins attributes based on location.</p>\n<h5>Search/Select</h5>\n<p>This is more of a user interface capability, where you can interactively browse through each record in a data source. Alternatively, you can set the search criteria and match the value based on that query.</p>\n<h4>Where can MMQGIS be Downloaded? </h4>\n<p>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8241498434446947\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8241498434446947\" data-ad-slot=\"8032514287\"></ins>\n<script>\n\t\t(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\t</script>\n</p>\n<h2>Extending QGIS Functionality with Python Automations</h2>\n<p>PyQGIS refers to the Python environment within <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/qgis-free-open-source-cross-platform-gis.html\"><strong>QGIS</strong></a>. It allows users to automate workflow and extend QGIS with the use of Python libraries. But it’s not only Python core libraries.</p>\n<p>You can also leverage thousands of third-party libraries adding functionality with scientific and data analysis. Python can be used with QGIS to manipulate GIS data and perform advanced analysis.</p>\n<h3>PyQGIS: Accessing and Utilizing the Python Console</h3>\n<p>One way to access PyQGIS is through the Python Console:</p>\n<p>Plugins &gt; Python Console</p>\n<p>The first option is to write Python code line-by-line in the console. But the Python Console also has a script editor (IDE), which makes it easier to save and run scripts.</p>\n<p>For example, you can write your own tools and mix various libraries installed in QGIS to extend it.</p>\n<h3>Exploring Algorithm History in PyQGIS: Learning from Pre-ran Tools</h3>\n<p>Every time you run a tool in QGIS, it also stores the history. But these pre-ran tools that you run also create a Python dictionary. One of the best ways to familiarize yourself with PyQGIS is by checking the code from your algorithm history.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use this as a starting point for your own custom script. You can access the processing history by clicking the “clock” icon in the Processing Toolbox.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"406\" height=\"340\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvMBEWAAE3OTB-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>Building Repeatable Workflows in QGIS with the Graphical Modeler</h3>\n<p>The Graphical Modeler is a visual way to string different processing algorithms together. If you’re familiar with ArcGIS ModelBuilder, it’s similar but for QGIS. All you have to do is drop inputs, outputs, and algorithms to the interface.</p>\n<p>Then, you connect them together sequentially in the order you want to run. This is how you build a repeatable workflow in QGIS. But you can also export the Graphical Model as a Python script. Again, this makes an excellent starting point for a script.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"864\" height=\"420\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvNlBWAA4Q-yc-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>Creating Custom Python Algorithms in PyQGIS: Extending Processing Toolbox </h3>\n<p>If you go to the Processing Toolbox, you can find the Python icon. This is how you can build your own scripts, which will open the IDE. Alternatively, you can create a new script from a template.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/F1VvOVbXsAALqni.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"349\" height=\"253\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/71/responsive/F1VvOVbXsAALqni-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This pre-written code can help you save time writing your own processing tools.

            "content_html": "<p>The process of floodplain mapping involves several steps and the integration of various data sources. Here is a general overview of the process and the types of data used.</p>\n<h2>Data Collection</h2>\n<p>The first step in floodplain mapping is to gather relevant data. This includes both spatial data and non-spatial data. Spatial data may include topographic information (elevation, slope, and aspect), hydrological data (river networks, stream flow measurements) and land cover data (vegetation, impervious surfaces). Non-spatial data can include historical flood records, rainfall data, and hydraulic modeling parameters.</p>\n<h2>Topographic Data</h2>\n<p>Accurate topographic data is crucial for floodplain mapping. <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/where-to-find-a-digital-elevation-model-dem.html\"><strong>Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)</strong></a> are commonly used, which provide elevation values for each pixel or grid cell within the study area. DEMs can be obtained from sources such as <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/free-sources-of-lidar-data.html\"><strong>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</strong></a> surveys, satellite imagery, or existing topographic maps.</p>\n<h2>Hydrological Modeling</h2>\n<p>Hydrological models simulate the behavior of water within a river basin or watershed. These models utilize inputs such as precipitation data, soil properties, land cover, and river channel characteristics to predict how water will flow and accumulate during a flood event. The output from hydrological models provides information on water levels, flow velocities, and flood extents.</p>\n<h2>Hydraulic Modeling</h2>\n<p>Hydraulic models focus on the behavior of water within river channels and floodplain areas. These models use the outputs from hydrological models as inputs and consider factors like channel geometry, roughness coefficients, and bridge and culvert capacity during a flood event. The output from hydrological models provides information on water levels, flow velocities, and flood extents.</p>\n<h2>Floodplain Zoning</h2>\n<p>Once the hydraulic modeling is completed, the floodplain can be divided into different zones based on the severity and frequency of flooding. These zones typically include the 100-year floodplain (the area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year), the 500-year floodplain (the area with a 0.2% chance of flooding in any given year), and sometimes additional zones for lesser flood events.</p>\n<h2>Map Creation and Visualization</h2>\n<p>The final step is to create floodplain maps using <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/importance-of-open-source-gis-software.html\"><strong>Geographic Information System (GIS)</strong></a> software. This involves overlaying the various data layers, such as topographic data, hydrological modeling results, and floodplain zoning, to generate comprehensive maps. These maps visually represent the floodplain areas, flood depths, flow velocities, and other relevant information.</p>",

This article unravels the workings, advantages, and shortcomings of Geohashing as a geospatial data structure.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Geohashing?</strong></h2>\n<p>Geohashing is a geocoding method used to encode geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a short string of letters and numbers. The system was created by Gustavo Niemeyer in 2008. The primary aim of Geohashing is to convert lengthy numerical coordinates into simpler alphanumeric representations, thus making them easier to use, remember, and share. The longer the Geohash, the more precise the location it describes.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Does Geohashing Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Geohashing works by dividing the world into a grid of squares, assigning each square a unique hash value. The process starts by bisecting the world into two regions, encoding the west or east hemisphere as 0 or 1, and similarly, encoding the south or north hemisphere as 0 or 1. This process continues, each step dividing the regions further, and assigning a binary value to each subdivision. This sequence of binary values forms a binary string, which is then converted into a base-32 representation, where numbers from 0-9 and letters from b-z (excluding a, i, l, and o to avoid confusion) are used.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Geohashing Explained to a Ten Year Old</strong></h2>\n<p>Imagine you're playing a game of hide and seek in a large park, and you want to tell your friends where you are hiding without making it too easy. Instead of describing the exact location (like \"I'm hiding behind the large oak tree next to the pond\"), you divide the park into numbered sections. So, you might tell them \"I'm in section 3.\" But if your friends haven't found you yet and need more help, you could divide section 3 into smaller sections (like 3a, 3b, 3c, etc.) and give them another hint: \"I'm in section 3b.\"</p>\n<p>That's similar to how Geohashing works. It takes a big place (like the entire world), and gives every small part of it a unique code. If you only give a short code, it points to a large area. If you give a longer code, it points to a smaller area. This allows us to share our location in a way that is as precise or as general as we want.</p>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Geohashing</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplicity and Versatility:</strong> Geohashing simplifies geospatial data handling by reducing complex coordinates into manageable strings. It's versatile as the length of the hash can be increased or decreased for precision or generalization respectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficient Proximity Searches:</strong> Geohashing is excellent for proximity searches. By comparing the prefixes of Geohashes, one can effectively determine the proximity of two locations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ease of Implementation:</strong> Geohashing is easier to implement compared to many other spatial data structures. It does not require complex algorithms or balancing operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Limitations of Geohashing</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Precision Limitations:</strong> Geohashes can become quite long if high precision is needed. This may negate the benefit of simplicity for some use cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edge Case Inaccuracy:</strong> Locations that are geographically close but fall on different sides of a geohash boundary will have very different geohashes, complicating proximity searches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Non-uniform Distribution:</strong> Earth is a sphere, but geohashes treat it like a flat surface, leading to distortions especially near the poles. The size of a geohash square varies based on latitude.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Geohashing presents an innovative, efficient, and simple way to handle geospatial data. While it has its limitations, such as edge case inaccuracies and precision issues, the benefits of simplicity, efficient proximity searches, and ease of implementation make it a popular choice for geocoding. As with any geospatial data structure, understanding its intricacies is key to making the most of its potential.

Their unique property of preserving locality and converting multi-dimensional data into a one-dimensional form offers various advantages in geospatial data processing. This article explores the functionality, benefits, and limitations of Space-Filling Curves in managing geospatial data.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are Space-Filling Curves?</strong></h2>\n<p>Space-filling curves are continuous curves that pass through every point in a multi-dimensional grid exactly once. These curves can map a multi-dimensional space onto a one-dimensional space, preserving the spatial locality of the data points. Popular space-filling curves include the Hilbert Curve, Peano Curve, and Z-order (or Morton) Curve.</p>\n<h2><strong>How Do Space-Filling Curves Work?</strong></h2>\n<p>Space-filling curves traverse through each cell of a multi-dimensional grid exactly once, converting multi-dimensional data into a one-dimensional sequence. By maintaining the locality of data points during this conversion, the curves enable efficient spatial and range queries. These curves can be thought of as a road map that a very meticulous delivery person might follow: starting at one end of their territory, they cover every single location (or \"cell\") exactly once without any backtracking, until the entire territory is covered.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/Peanocurve.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"391\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/53/responsive/Peanocurve.svg-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Think of a space-filling curve as a very careful gardener who has to water every plant in a large rectangular garden exactly once. The garden is divided into smaller square patches, each containing a single plant. The gardener starts at one corner of the garden and walks in a continuous path that winds back and forth, up and down, covering every small patch without leaving any out or watering any twice. Regardless of the garden's size, the gardener's path is unbroken and never crosses itself, ensuring each plant gets watered exactly once. Similarly, a space-filling curve \"visits\" every point in a multi-dimensional space without skipping or repeating any point, providing a method to traverse through all the data points in a systematic and efficient way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1><strong>Benefits of Space-Filling Curves</strong></h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Locality-Preserving:</strong> One of the primary advantages of Space-Filling Curves is their ability to preserve spatial locality. This feature ensures that data points close to each other in the multi-dimensional space remain close in the one-dimensional sequence, enhancing the efficiency of range queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The concept and construction of Space-Filling Curves are straightforward. This simplicity allows for easy implementation and use in a variety of applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reduced Dimensionality:</strong> By converting multi-dimensional data into one-dimensional data, Space-Filling Curves reduce the complexity associated with handling multi-dimensional data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Limitations of Space-Filling Curves</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Limited Precision:</strong> The precision of mapping is limited to the granularity of the grid used. The finer the grid, the more precise the mapping, but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and storage requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complexity of Higher-Order Curves:</strong> Constructing higher-order space-filling curves can be complex and computationally intensive. This complexity grows with the increase in dimensionality and resolution of the grid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Partial Coverage:</strong> When dealing with a query range that does not align perfectly with the grid's cells, space-filling curves may return extra points that are not in the query range. This necessitates an additional filtering step to remove these extra points.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Space-Filling Curves offer a unique approach to handling geospatial data by reducing dimensionality while preserving spatial locality. Although they have some limitations, like precision constraints and complexity of higher-order curves, their benefits like locality preservation, simplicity, and reduced dimensionality make them a valuable tool in geospatial data management.

            "content_html": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Among the array of data structures used for geospatial data management, the Uniform Grid stands out due to its simplicity and efficiency. Used for handling spatial data in a variety of applications such as gaming, physics simulations, and GIS, the Uniform Grid is designed for both practicality and performance. To appreciate its full potential, we need to understand its functionality, benefits, and limitations. This article provides an in-depth overview of the Uniform Grid as a geospatial data structure.</p>\n<h2>What is Uniform Grid?</h2>\n<p>A Uniform Grid is a spatial data structure that divides the entire space into equal-sized cells, forming a grid. Each cell in the grid can store data points that fall within its boundaries. This grid-based system simplifies spatial queries and operations, as the resolution of the grid remains consistent throughout the space.</p>\n<h2>How Does Uniform Grid Work?</h2>\n<p>The Uniform Grid divides the spatial region of interest into equal-sized cells, forming a 2D or 3D grid. Each cell in the grid can store one or more data points. When performing a spatial query, the algorithm only needs to search within specific cells rather than scanning the entire data set. This strategy makes the data structure efficient for collision detection and nearest neighbor search, among other spatial queries.</p>\n<p>To explain it with an analogy, consider a city map divided into equal-sized squares, where each square represents a specific area of the city. If we need to locate a particular building, instead of searching the entire city map, we can identify the square in which the building is located, and search only within that square.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Uniform Grid</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Efficiency: </strong>One of the primary benefits of a Uniform Grid is the efficiency it brings to spatial queries. By segmenting the space into regular cells, the grid reduces the number of comparisons needed in a query, speeding up search times considerably.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The Uniform Grid structure is conceptually straightforward and relatively easy to implement. The regularity of the cells and the simplicity of the operations make it an attractive option for many applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Uniform Grids can easily scale to handle large datasets. Regardless of the size of the data, the performance of spatial queries remains consistent because only the relevant grid cells are searched.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Limitations of Uniform Grid</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fixed Resolution:</strong> The resolution of a Uniform Grid is fixed, which can be a limitation when dealing with datasets of varying density. In areas where data points are sparse, the grid cells may be under-utilized, whereas in dense areas, cells may become overcrowded.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Consumption:</strong> Uniform Grids may require substantial memory, especially in three dimensions. This is because every cell in the grid requires memory, even if it does not contain any data points.</li>\n<li><strong>Inefficient with Non-Uniform Data:</strong> For non-uniform data, a significant portion of the grid cells may be empty, leading to an inefficient use of memory and potentially slower queries.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Uniform Grid structure, despite some limitations, offers a simple yet powerful tool for handling geospatial data. Its efficiency, simplicity, and scalability make it widely used in various fields. However, its fixed resolution and potential for high memory consumption necessitate careful consideration when choosing the right tool for geospatial data management.

This article presents a comprehensive overview of the Quad-Tree geospatial data structure.</p>\n<h2>What is Quad-Tree?</h2>\n<p>Quad-Tree, as the name implies, is a tree data structure where each internal node has exactly four children: north-west, north-east, south-west, and south-east. Quad-Trees are primarily used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. Introduced by Finkel and Bentley in 1974, Quad-Trees gained prominence in fields like computer graphics and GIS for their ability to quickly locate points in a plane.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"527\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/51/responsive/Quad_tree_bitmap.svg-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>How Does Quad-Tree Work?</h2>\n<p>The root node of a Quad-Tree represents the entire area under consideration. As we move down the tree, the area gets divided into four equal quadrants, and each quadrant corresponds to a child node. This subdivision continues until a threshold condition is met, usually when a node contains only one data point, or when it reaches a predetermined depth.</p>\n<p>Imagine a map divided into four parts. If a region contains significant data (like cities, terrain, etc.), it is further split into four smaller parts. This subdivision continues until we reach an area that contains only one piece of significant data or none.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Quad-Tree</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Speed and Efficiency: </strong>Quad-Trees facilitate fast region queries and updates as they reduce the search space considerably with each level.</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Resolution:</strong> Quad-Trees offer an adaptive resolution as different regions of space can be represented at different levels of detail. For example, a region with a high concentration of data points can be subdivided more than a region with few data points, offering a higher resolution where needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Intuitive and Easy to Implement:</strong> Quad-Trees follow a simple rule for subdivision, and hence are relatively easier and more intuitive to implement than other spatial data structures.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Limitations of Quad-Tree</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inefficient with Irregular Data: </strong>Quad-Trees may not be efficient when data is distributed irregularly, leading to trees that are deeper on one side. This could potentially result in longer query times.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficulty Handling Dynamic Data:</strong> Quad-Trees are not particularly well-suited for handling data that changes frequently (dynamic data). Adding and removing points can cause significant changes to the structure of the tree, potentially leading to a high computational cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Not Optimal for High-Dimensional Data: </strong>Quad-Trees are ideal for two-dimensional data. However, as the number of dimensions increases, the number of children for each node increases exponentially, making the tree highly inefficient.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Despite some limitations, Quad-Trees serve as a powerful tool in spatial data indexing, particularly in dealing with two-dimensional data. They offer quick spatial queries and can adapt to different data densities, making them useful in various applications.

This system is based on two values: easting and northing. Easting measures how far east or west a location is from a central meridian within the zone.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/utm4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"427\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm4-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Northing measures how far north or south a location is from the Equator.</p>\n<h2>Units</h2>\n<p>The units used for easting and northing are typically in meters. So, instead of using degrees, which are used in latitude and longitude, we use meters for more precise measurements</p>\n<h2>Coordinates for Locations</h2>\n<p>When you want to describe a specific location using the UTM system, you provide the zone number and its easting and northing values. For example, you might say a location is in Zone 33, with an easting of 500,000 and a northing of 4,000,000 meters.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/utm5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"480\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/49/responsive/utm5-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>UTM is widely used for navigation, mapping, and surveying purposes because it provides a standard and accurate way to communicate locations regardless of where you are on Earth. It's much simpler to use than latitude and longitude.</p>",

dataframe consists of 57552 entries corresponding to the filtered data from our original VIIRS product dataset of detected hotspots. The first entry is from March 2012, while the last one is from December of 2021. This dataset is the result of initial processing and modifications made to the original one. These modifications included the removal of certain columns and the addition of others that are particularly useful for this part, such as “year_acq” and “month_acq”.

However, you can come up with your own ideas to focus your analysis and obtain your own insights from either the original or the processed dataset.  </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processing of data before visualization</h4>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">If you haven’t noticed before, there are multiple entries for each day, corresponding to different hotspots detected within our study area. You can verify this by examining the columns corresponding to the coordinates associated with each entry, “latitude” and “longitude”. Therefore, the first step to perform is to count the number of hotspots per day, independently of their geographic position.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"476\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/13-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">It’s worth noting from above that we had to include some additional code to reformat the data and recreate certain columns that were deleted during previous processing stages.

It allows us to analyze various aspects of the occurrence of fires in our study area during the selected time period. One of this aspects is that there were extended periods with few or no fires, as well as periods with a higher frequency. Additionally, not all periods had the same number of detected hotspots, with some having a higher frequency of fires than others. Between these periods there where two notable periods with a high frequency of fires are the peaks in 2020 and 2021. Other interesting peaks occurred in 2012, 2013 and 2018. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">To continue with the analysis, let’s take a closer look at the three years with the highest frequency of fires (years with the highest peaks). Because of the irregular distribution of fires throughout the year, as shown in the plot, it’s challenging to identify if 2012, 2013 or 2018 had the highest number of fires. To address this, we can further our analysis with a bar plot that shows the total number of hotspots detected by year.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"413\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/20-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"430\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/21-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>The latest bar plot provides us further insight into the interpretation of the first plot. Since each bar shows the total detected hotspots for a given year, regardless of at which month it occurred, it’s easier to identify which years had the highest frequency of fires. However, this plot doesn’t definitively identify the year with the third highest frequency of fires, apart from 2020 and 2021. To clarify this, we can delve deeper into the dataframe used to create the bar plot.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/22-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"214\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/23-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Finally, after analyzing the dataframe shown above, we can confirm that the three top years with the highest number of detected hotspots were 2018, 2020 and 2021. With this information we can continue with a more detailed examination. First, we will explore the occurrences of fires throughout the year for each of these years. Then, we will identify the top five days with the highest number of detected hotspots for these three years. Note that the number of top years and days were chosen arbitrarily. You can choose your own top including more years and days, depending on your criteria.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/24.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"646\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/24-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/25.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"352\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/25-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/26.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"159\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/26-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/27.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"651\" height=\"190\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/27-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Upon examining the output from the previous code, we can draw some interesting conclusions. Firstly, it’s worth noting that the month with the highest number of fires detected in all three years was the month number 08, August. This reinforces what we already knew about our study area, that fires tend to occur towards the end of winter. Secondly, it’s also interesting to observe that the total number of fires in 2020 was much higher than in the other years with, for example, a 1:10 ratio for August 2018. Thirdly, unlike what happened in 2018 and 2020, the fire activity in 2021 in the study area was relatively constant throughout the year. Lastly, after reviewing the tables for the top five days with the highest number of detected hotspots, it becomes evident that most of the days fell in the period within the last 10 days of August.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Analysis of spatial distribution of fires</h4>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Now, we can leverage the full potential of our georeferenced dataset to create more interesting plots. Building upon our previous analysis, where we identified the years, months, and specific days with the highest number of detected hotspots, let’s explore the spatial distribution of these hotspots in our study area. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">To begin, we will plot all the hotspots detected during the top three years with the highest occurrences of fires separetely. This will provide us with a visual representation of the geographic spread of these fires.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/28.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"482\" height=\"512\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/28-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"402\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/29-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-small-font-size\">These plots provide us insights into the spatial distribution of the fires detected during the chosen years. Despite being the top three years, the number of detected hotspots varies among them, which is evident in the plots shown before. In 2018, the fires were dispersed throughout the study area, with a higher concentration in the upper region. In 2020, the fires occurred in almost every part of the River Parana Delta, but the density was relatively lower in the bottom section. In 2021, we can observe a higher density on the middle and lower regions, with a concentrated area of maximum intensity. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">While the previous plots show us the overall spatial distribution of fires throughout the year, it is important to note that the fire occurrence in the study area is not uniform. As we discovered earlier, the peak of hotspot detection for all three years falls in August, the month number eight. Now, let’s explore deeper into the spatial distribution by analyzing the number of fires detected before and after August, including August itself.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/30.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"709\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/30-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1023\" height=\"375\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/31-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">As we discussed before, the fires occur towards the end of the winter to facilitate grass regrowth for pasture. The preceding plots confirm this and provide some extra valuable insights for our analysis. According to the plots, in 2018 and 2020 the highest number of fires occurred during months 8 to 12. However, there were differences in their distribution pattern. On the other hand, for 2021 we can observe that fires in months 1-7 were significantly important, almost equaling the ones that occurred in months 7-12. This supports what we observed in the bar plot made before for this year.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">To conclude our analysis, we can incorporate an additional visualization. We will examine the distribution of hotspots detected during the last ten days of August in 2018, 2020 and 2021. The idea is to attempt to identify any patterns during the days found as the ones with the highest number of fires detected in our study period.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/32-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"688\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/33-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/34.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"728\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/46/responsive/34-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">From the last plot we can observe that when comparing the same period of days for the three years, there is no consistent pattern in spatial distribution of the fires. For example, one might expect to find a similarity in the locations where the fires occurred, with a superposition of all the detected hotspots. This was not the case for the years and the period chosen. However, what becomes evident is that each year exhibits distinct clusters of fires of different sizes, which may have originated from independent initial fire sources and subsequently expanded.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">After this final analysis, one question arises: what factors contributed to this particular behavior during the days identified as the ones with the highest number of fires? While most of the fires in our study area have a human cause, it would be interesting to understand why these fires originated in specific locations rather than in other areas.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-justify\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Throughout this post, divided in two parts, we have worked with a VIIRS Active Fire product dataset obtained from the NASA-FIRMS website for our study area and a specific time period. In the first part we did a preliminary processing and extracted the relevant data of interest. In the second part we conducted an additional processing to visualize the dataset obtained in the <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/analysis-of-fires-parana-river-delta-argentina-using-viirs-part-1.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>first part</strong></span></a>. This enabled us to gain valuable insights into the occurrence of fires in the Parana River delta and address different questions about this, while also uncovering new ones. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">One of the questions addressed in this post pertains to the identification of the three years, from 2012 to 2021, with the highest number of detected fires. Additionally, we explored the temporal distribution of the fires throughout the year for these specific years. Then, through further processing and analysis, we were able to identify the exact day with the highest number of fires during the aforementioned time period. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Another significant aspect of this analysis involved the spatial distribution of fires. We examined how the detected fires were spatially distributed during the three years with the highest number of occurrences. This allowed us to observe similarities and differences among these years.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Finally, one question arose: What factors caused the initial location of the fire clusters found in August for 2018, 2020 and 2021? Was it solely due to anthropogenic causes? Were the weather conditions or the hydrology?  Or was it a combination of all of these factors? These questions will be explored in future posts.</p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<p>Salvia, M. M. (2010).

This guide will cover from loading and extracting the desired data from a dataset requested from NASA-FIRMS web page, to the processing and visualization of this data in order to gain valuable insights into the fire phenomena within the chosen study area and period of time.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">This analysis will be focused on the Paraná River delta region in Argentina covering the period from 2012 to 2021. As elucidated later on, the data selected was the VIIRS Active Fire detection product data because the association between the hotspots detected by the sensor and vegetation fires. In the first part we will conduct a preliminary processing and extract the relevant data from a dataset encompassing fire occurrences throughout Argentina. The resulting dataset will subsequently serve to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the fires in our study area during the period selected.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study area introduction</h2>\n<p>The Paraná River delta is one of the most important wetland spaces in Argentina and covers an area of 17.500 km<sup>2</sup>. It is located in the territories of the provinces of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Buenos Aires. In addition to its important ecosystem functions (such as housing a great variety of biodiversity, being a carbon sink, among other), it is also a territory where island residents live, as well as having economic value for its resources and the livestock farming that takes places there.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"413\" height=\"412\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/1-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Map representing study area location</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The burning of vegetation is a common practice in the Paraná Delta and its purpose is to remove those with little or no forage value for livestock. This practice is mainly carried out at the end of the winter with the aim of facilitating the regrowth of tender grasses for the cattle. In recent years, the large fires in the Paraná Delta have gained notoriety due the intensity and the number of areas affected, not to mention the serious consequences on the health of nearby populations such as Rosario city residents in Santa Fe province.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"375\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/2-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Aerial photography showing grasslands areas in Paraná River delta burning (Extracted from <a href=\"http://www.agrofy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.agrofy.com</a><sup>1</sup>)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">It should be noted that the delta area is strongly affected by the hydrological regime of the Parana and, to a lesser extent, Uruguay rivers. This area is also affected by meteorological events. Therefore, in a context where the effects of climate change are increasingly evident, which is reflected in historical lows of the mentioned rivers, heat waves and decreased precipitation, the availability of dry biomass that can be fuel for fires increases considerably. This, in turn, results in the previously mentioned situation, intense and difficult to control fires, which end up affecting large areas.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Considering all of the above, analyzing the phenomenon of fires in this area is of utmost importance in order to understand its temporal occurrence and spatial distribution, among other characteristics, with the goal of developing tools for the proper environmental management of this region in the current context.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Methodology</h2>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The processing of fires detected data from VIIRS product, which boasts a spatial resolution of 375 m, will be performed using Python and basic data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, among others. More specific libraries will be used, such as Geopandas, which is highly useful for the analysis of georeferenced data. In addition to these VIIRS data, vector layer files will be implemented for the study area delimitation and relevant data filtering. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">All the data and vector layers files were obtained from public access repositories. Finally, the implementation of the analysis was designed to be carried out in the Google Colaboratory environment with the aim of making it easier to perform for anyone interested.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step-by-step guide preliminary processing and extraction of data</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Libraries and functions</h3>\n<p>The first important thing we have to do is to import the necessary libraries, such as libraries for data processing and visualization, and Google libraries to load files stored in Google Drive, in case host your files there. Also we need to load that functions that will be used. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"625\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/3-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"603\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/4-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data Loading</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The format in which we can obtain data about fires from VIIRS products may vary. We can access and download this data from the FIRMS site database for different years individually, or we can make a request through the page and the data for the requested period can be returned to us. In the first case, we will have several files that we will have to merge later. In contrast, in the second case, we will receive an unified file. Regardless of the situation, loading of data will be executed as described below.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">For loading the files containing the data, we will create a dictionary with a generic name for each csv file as dictionary key, and the file link or path as the corresponding key value, depending on where the file is hosted.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"476\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/5-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>In our case, we will be working with a dataset that contains all the hotspots detected by VIIRS sensor for Argentina in the period 2011-2022, so we will use the code for the second case (unified data in a single file). Before creating our dataframe with data for further processing, let’s check if the data loads as we expect and datatypes are correct.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/6-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"124\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/7-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">If you get the output as shown in the image above, it indicates that the data has been loaded correctly.

Now, let’s proceed with the processing of this data in order to extract the data relevant to our study area and period of analysis.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data Processing</strong></h3>\n<p>Considering that the data contained in the dataframe corresponds to hotspots detected in Argentina, the first thing we will do is create a copy of the original one and give it a more appropriate name.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/15-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Having created the copy we can proceed with processing the dataset. First, we will add two additional columns, “year_acq” and “month_acq”, corresponding to the year and month of the date when the heat spot was detected. Then, given that our analysis period is from 2011 to 2021, we will filter the dataset based on the “year_acq” value, excluding the records equal to 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Finally, we will filter data based on the “type” column, selecting only records with a value of 0. The entries with this type value are the ones associated with presumed vegetation fire according to the description provided on the NASA-Earth Data website. As commented before, the data chosen to conduct this analysis was VIIRS Active Fire detection product data because direct link to fires. Hence, this step holds significant importance in ensuring the accuracy of our analysis.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"989\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/16-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Type column values for VIIRS product dataset (Extracted from NASA-Earth Data website<sup>2</sup>)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"766\" height=\"328\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/17-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data Visualization and Extraction of Study Area Points</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">One of the particularities of georeferenced data is that we can plot it over a map and visualize its distribution in the space. In our case, we have a dataset that contains fires detected across the entire territory of Argentina, but our study area is just Paraná River delta. The next step is to select all the points that are within our study area. To achieve this, we will visualize the hotspots in our dataframe, its distribution in Argentina and our study area. </p>\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The first thing we have to do is to create a geodataframe from our original fataframe using Geopandas library. Note that we set as CRS (Coordinate Reference System) EPSG:4326. This system represents latitude on the Y-axis and ranges from -90 to 90 degrees, with the equator at 0 degrees latitude. Longitude is represented on the X-axis and ranges from -180 to 180 degrees, with the prime meridian (Greenwich meridian) at 0 degrees longitude.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"765\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/18-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Once we have our data as a geodataframe, we need to load vector layers for Argentina and our study area. To accomplish this, we will load vector layers files as shapefiles in Colab and get its path as it is showed in figure below, then we will convert it into geodataframe too. Note that by default the CRS of both is EPSG:4326.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"233\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/19-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Loading files in Colab environment</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/45/responsive/20-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>After loading our data and vector layers as geodataframes, we are ready to visualize all of it.

Firstly, the images show how severe was the situation in Argentina for the study period regarding fires that occurred. Secondly, the data was loaded and processed correctly.

In applications that require spatial indexing, such as logistics or urban planning, R-Trees offer dynamic, efficient, and balanced solutions. However, to effectively utilize these structures, a comprehensive understanding of their functionality, benefits, and limitations is crucial. This article provides an in-depth exploration of R-Trees, demystifying their role and operation in handling geospatial data.</p>\n<h2>What is R-Tree?</h2>\n<p>An R-Tree (Rectangle Tree) is a tree data structure used for indexing multi-dimensional information, such as geographical coordinates, rectangles, or polygons. The \"R\" in R-Tree stands for Rectangle — the foundational unit of this data structure. It was proposed by Antonin Guttman in 1984 as an extension to other tree data structures like B-Trees, to handle spatial data efficiently.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/R-tree.svg/1024px-R-tree.svg.png\" alt=\"undefined\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h2>How Does R-Tree Work?</h2>\n<p>R-Trees group nearby objects and represent them with their minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) in the next higher level of the tree. The primary goal of R-Tree is to minimize the coverage of each node (minimize the area, perimeter, margin or overlap of rectangles). The rectangles in R-Trees often overlap, leading to an efficient storage and quick spatial queries, which is an advantage over other structures like QuadTrees, where there is no overlap, but more partitions leading to deeper trees.</p>\n<h3>How an R-Tree Works Explained to a Ten Year Old</h3>\n<p>Let's imagine you have a big box filled with lots of different toys - cars, dolls, action figures, legos, and so on. Now, you want to find your favorite action figure without going through the entire box. It's going to be really difficult if the toys are all mixed up, right?</p>\n<p>So, you decide to organize your box to make it easier to find your toys. You place different types of toys into smaller boxes: one for cars, one for dolls, one for legos, and one for action figures. Each of these smaller boxes goes into the big box. Now, when you want to find your favorite action figure, you only need to look in the smaller box for action figures, not the entire big box!</p>\n<p>An R-tree data structure works in a similar way, but instead of toys, it's used for things like locations on a map. Just like your toy box, a map can have lots and lots of data points - like cities, streets, houses, and parks. An R-tree organizes this data by grouping nearby locations together into smaller 'boxes' or regions. These regions are then put into bigger regions, and so on, until we have one big region containing all the others.</p>\n<p>So, when a computer wants to find a location using an R-tree, it doesn't need to look at every single point on the map. Instead, it first looks at the big regions, then the smaller ones within the relevant big region, and so on, until it finds the location it's looking for. This makes searching much quicker and more efficient!</p>\n<h2>Benefits of R-Tree</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficient Queries</strong>: One of the main benefits of using R-Trees is the efficiency of spatial queries. The R-Tree is designed to maximize data locality, meaning it minimizes the amount of disk I/O operations and makes queries faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dynamic</strong>: R-Trees are dynamic, allowing insertions and deletions as data changes. This allows the R-Tree to adjust to the evolving needs of geospatial data handling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Balanced</strong>: Like other tree data structures, R-Trees are balanced, meaning the path from the root to any leaf is the same length. This balanced nature guarantees logarithmic time search performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Limitations of R-Tree</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Overlapping Nodes</strong>: Overlapping bounding boxes in nodes is one of the main limitations of R-Trees. It increases the likelihood of checking more branches and leads to slower query performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complexity in Implementation</strong>: The algorithm to implement and maintain R-Trees is complex. Effective strategies are required for splitting nodes in order to maintain the balance of the tree and to minimize overlapping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Difficulty Handling High-Dimensional Data</strong>: Although R-Trees can theoretically handle high-dimensional data, in practice, their performance degrades quickly as the number of dimensions increases. This is because the probability of overlap increases exponentially with the increase in dimensions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Understanding the R-Tree structure is key to effectively leveraging geospatial data. Although R-Trees come with limitations such as overlap, complexity, and difficulties in high-dimensional data handling, their benefits like efficient spatial queries, dynamic nature, and balance make them an essential tool in geospatial data management. It's crucial to be aware of both the advantages and the limitations of R-Trees when choosing the right tool for your geospatial data handling needs.

With the rise of the web, GIS has become more accessible than ever before, and new tools are constantly being developed to make GIS more user-friendly, powerful, and versatile.</p>\n<p id=\"b504\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When I started as a geospatial developer about eight years ago, the biggest question I used to have was “what are the right technologies for this particular webGIS system?” In all these years and with my progression from a freelance webGIS developer to the founder of a<em><strong> <a class=\"ae ly\" href=\"https://periegesis.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">webGIS apps development company</a></strong></em>, I figured it out to the extent that answering this question became pretty easy.</p>\n<p id=\"fbcb\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In 2019, I wrote about the <em><strong><a class=\"ae ly\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/tools-i-recommend-for-building-geospatial-web-applications-274d6939536c\">Tools I recommend for building Geospatial Web Applications</a></strong></em> and this is going to be an updated version of that because in the past 3.5 years, new technologies have emerged and I have learned new things as well so I decided to write an updated version of it that suits better for the needs of 2023 and beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"dd71\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In this story, I will be recommending open-source tools because they offer a cost-effective and flexible solution with a large community of developers constantly working to improve and update them.

Other than the mapping part, I strongly recommend using any frontend framework to make development better, easier, and faster. My team usually uses ReactJS for this purpose due to the ease of development and the wide support it has from the development community but you can choose any framework of your liking.</p>\n<p id=\"e3fc\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The geospatial frontend can be further divided into two categories:</p>\n<h2 id=\"9ebc\" class=\"um tw rk bd lj io un ip gb is uo it gf ti up uq gj tm ur us gn tq ut uu gr uv bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Two Dimensional visualization</h2>\n<p id=\"cbd5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc uh fz te tf ui gd th ti uj tk tl tm uk to tp tq ul ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For two-dimensional visualization, I recommend <em><strong><a class=\"ae ly\" href=\"https://leafletjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Leaflet</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a class=\"ae ly\" href=\"https://openlayers.org/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OpenLayers</a></strong></em>. My rule is simple: If it is a simple application, use <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-62\">Leaflet</a> for its simplicity and ease of use. If it requires slightly complex use cases like displaying multiple layers in different projection systems, then go for <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-68\">OpenLayers</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"f8ab\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I once had to change my strategy and redevelop a map in Openlayers that I had already developed in Leaflet because we had to add layers in different coordinate systems.</p>\n<figure class=\"sp sq sr ss qd st ht hu paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"su sv di sw bf sx\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"ht hu uw\"><figure class=\"bf sy sz c\"> <source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"> <source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img  role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*5jXJaAgjzf0F6Yn7mEHHaw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure> </picture></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"ux ot pv ht hu uy uz bd b be z dm\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">A map my team developed with OpenLayers for <a class=\"ae ly\" href=\"https://locationhealth.vercel.app/en\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Locationhealth</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"3a9d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph ta tb rk jj b tc td fz te tf tg gd th ti tj tk tl tm tn to tp tq tr ts tt tu ih bi\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In two-dimensional visualization, one tool I didn’t talk about in the last story is <em><strong><a class=\"ae ly\" href=\"https://kepler.gl/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kepler.gl</a></strong></em>.

This section aims to unpack the complexities and nuances of geospatial data to enable better decision-making and more effective application in various fields.</p>\n<h3>Types of Geospatial Data</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/Simple_vector_map.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Simple_vector_map.svg-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>Vector Data</h4>\n<p>Vector data is primarily made up of points, lines, and polygon shapes. Each of these elements is defined by a coordinate in space.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Points</strong>: Represent specific locations like street lamps, mailboxes, or any other object that can be represented by a single x, y coordinate. For example, the location of a particular store in a shopping mall can be depicted as a point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lines</strong>: Used to illustrate linear features such as roads, rivers, and utility lines. Each line is made up of a series of points connected in a particular sequence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Polygons</strong>: These are closed lines used to represent areas like lakes, building footprints, and city boundaries. Polygons are made up of multiple lines connected end-to-end.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vector data is often preferred for tasks that require precise measurements and clear delineations, such as cadastral mapping, transportation planning, and network analysis.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/Rgb-raster-image.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Rgb-raster-image.svg-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>Raster Data</h4>\n<p>Raster data consists of a matrix of cells or pixels that cover a specific geographical area. Each cell holds a value representing information like elevation, temperature, or vegetation type. This kind of data is particularly useful in applications like satellite imagery, weather mapping, and geological surveys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cell-based Representation</strong>: The granularity of the data is defined by the size of the cell. Smaller cells mean more detail but result in larger file sizes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Value Representation</strong>: Each cell can hold one or multiple values, offering either a simple representation, like land vs water, or a complex one like the RGB values for color images.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Raster data is beneficial for applications that require continuous data over a specific area, such as land cover mapping or climate modeling.</p>\n<h4>Characteristics of Geospatial Data</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Geographic Location</strong>: The most fundamental characteristic, it refers to the actual physical location where the data point exists. It's often expressed in terms of latitude and longitude or other coordinate systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spatial Relationships</strong>: This describes how different data points relate to each other in space. It can include proximity, intersection, and inclusion within boundaries. These relationships are essential in applications like route planning, disaster management, and landscape architecture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: These are additional data attached to geographic features. For example, a point representing a hospital would include attributes like name, number of beds, or emergency service availability. This added layer of information allows for a richer analysis and more nuanced understanding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/743px-ECEF.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"743\" height=\"600\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/743px-ECEF.svg-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)</h4>\n<p>Understanding CRS is pivotal for accurately mapping and analyzing data. A Coordinate Reference System provides the rules and frameworks needed to describe locations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Geographic Coordinate Systems</strong>: These are based on a spheroid and use latitude and longitude to define location. They are often used for global datasets and are ideal for preserving angles and areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Projected Coordinate Systems</strong>: These are 2D systems ideal for representing small areas. Unlike Geographic Coordinate Systems, these use x, y coordinates on a flat plane, making them useful for accurate distance and area calculations for localized projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Collection of Geospatial Data: A Deep Dive</h2>\n<p>The collection of geospatial data is a complex and nuanced process, requiring specialized knowledge, tools, and techniques. Below, we explore some of the primary methods and sources for collecting this indispensable form of data.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/Remote_Sensing_Illustration.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"599\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-xs.webp 300w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-sm.webp 480w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-md.webp 768w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-lg.webp 1024w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-xl.webp 1360w ,https://opensourcegisdata.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Remote_Sensing_Illustration-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>Remote Sensing: Eyes in the Sky</h3>\n<p>Remote sensing is a revolutionary technique that has vastly expanded our ability to collect geospatial data.

The structure of an R-Tree is based on a binary tree, where each node in the tree represents a rectangular region in the space. The nodes in the tree are used to represent and index spatial objects, such as points, lines, and polyggonal regions.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Advantages of Using R-Trees</h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/r-tree-geospatial-data-structure-benefits-and-limitations.html\">R-Trees</a></strong></span> have several advantages over other geospatial data structures. One of the primary advantages of R-Trees is their ability to handle large amounts of data. The structure of an R-Tree allows for quick indexing and retrieval of data, even when dealing with massive amounts of information. R-Trees are also capable of handling both static and dynamic data, making them an ideal choice for real-time applications.</p>\n<p>Additionally, R-Trees are efficient at handling data with high dimensions, making them a popular choice for geospatial applications. The tree structure of an R-Tree allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, even when dealing with complex geospatial data.</p>\n<h3>Disadvantages of Using R-Trees</h3>\n<p>While <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/r-tree-geospatial-data-structure-benefits-and-limitations.html\">R-Trees</a></strong></span> have several advantages, they also have some disadvantages. One of the primary disadvantages of R-Trees is their sensitivity to data distribution.

This makes it imperative for individuals, communities, and businesses to be prepared for such events. Using a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to perform a risk assessment is a powerful tool that can help organizations minimize the impact of natural disasters and plan for emergency response. </p>\n<h2>Understanding GIS Risk Assessment</h2>\n<p>GIS risk assessment is a process of using geospatial data and tools to identify, analyze, and map potential impacts of natural hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and fires. The goal of GIS risk assessment is to provide actionable information to decision makers, allowing them to prioritize resources and make informed decisions about preparedness and response efforts.</p>\n<p>GIS risk assessments consider various factors such as the frequency, severity, and likelihood of natural hazards, as well as the vulnerability of populations and assets. This information is then used to create maps and other visual representations of the potential impacts of these events, including estimates of economic losses and human casualties.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of GIS Risk Assessment for Natural Disasters</h2>\n<p>GIS risk assessments offer a number of benefits for organizations that are concerned about the impact of natural disasters. Some of the most important benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved preparedness: By mapping the potential impacts of natural disasters, organizations can prioritize their preparedness efforts and allocate resources more effectively.</li>\n<li>Better decision making: GIS risk assessments provide decision makers with the information they need to make informed decisions about emergency response and recovery efforts.</li>\n<li>Increased efficiency: By integrating geospatial data and analysis into disaster planning and response efforts, organizations can improve the efficiency of their operations and reduce the overall impact of natural disasters.</li>\n<li>Enhanced collaboration: GIS risk assessments can bring together different stakeholders and organizations to collaborate on disaster planning and response efforts, leading to more coordinated and effective response.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steps to Implementing GIS Risk Assessment</h2>\n<p>Implementing a GIS risk assessment for natural disasters involves several key steps, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data collection: The first step in implementing a GIS risk assessment is to gather and process geospatial data, including information on natural hazards, demographics, infrastructure, and land use.</li>\n<li>Analysis: The next step is to analyze the data to identify areas of high risk and to estimate the potential impacts of natural disasters.</li>\n<li>Mapping: The results of the analysis are then used to create maps and other visual representations of the potential impacts of natural disasters.</li>\n<li>Communication and dissemination: The results of the GIS risk assessment should be communicated to decision makers, stakeholders, and the general public, allowing them to make informed decisions about preparedness and response efforts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>GIS risk assessment is a powerful tool for organizations to minimize the impact of natural disasters and plan for emergency response. By integrating geospatial data and analysis into disaster planning and response efforts, organizations can improve their preparedness, increase their efficiency, and enhance collaboration among stakeholders. If you want to maximize your preparedness for natural disasters, consider implementing a GIS risk assessment in your organization today.</p>",

It is used in a wide range of industries, from urban planning and natural resource management to marketing and transportation. In this guide, we will explore the basics of GIS mapping and how it can be used to unlock insights and drive better decision-making.</p>\n<h2>What is GIS Mapping?</h2>\n<p>At its core, GIS mapping is a way to visualize and analyze data that has a geographic component. This can include anything from population density and land use patterns to weather patterns and crime rates. GIS mapping software allows users to overlay different layers of data, such as satellite imagery or street maps, and then analyze and manipulate that data to gain insights and make decisions.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of GIS Mapping</h2>\n<p>One of the key benefits of GIS mapping is its ability to reveal patterns and relationships in data that may not be immediately apparent. For example, a GIS map of population density may reveal a correlation between high population areas and areas with high levels of air pollution. This information can then be used to inform policy decisions, such as where to target air quality improvement efforts.</p>\n<p>GIS mapping is also a valuable tool for decision-making in a wide range of industries. In urban planning, for example, GIS maps can be used to identify potential sites for new development, assess the impact of proposed projects on the surrounding area, and plan for future growth. In the field of natural resource management, GIS mapping can be used to monitor and manage resources such as forests, water, and minerals.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started with GIS Mapping</h2>\n<p>To get started with GIS mapping, you will need a computer with GIS software installed and access to spatial data. There are many different GIS software options available, both free and paid, including open-source options like QGIS and commercial options like ArcGIS. Once you have the software, you can begin importing data and creating maps.</p>\n<p>One of the most important steps in getting started with GIS mapping is finding and acquiring high-quality data. There are many sources of spatial data available, including government agencies, universities, and private companies. It is important to ensure that the data you use is accurate and up-to-date, as well as in the appropriate format for your GIS software.</p>\n<h2>Advanced GIS Mapping Techniques</h2>\n<p>As you become more familiar with GIS mapping, you may want to explore more advanced techniques. For example, you can use GIS to create 3D maps and models, incorporating information such as elevation and building heights. You can also use GIS to create animations and simulations, such as visualizing the spread of a wildfire or the impact of a proposed development on traffic patterns.</p>\n<p>Another advanced technique is using GIS for spatial analysis. This allows you to use GIS tools to analyze patterns, relationships, and trends in your data. For example, you can use GIS to identify clusters of high crime rates, or to analyze how land use patterns are related to population density.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>GIS mapping is a powerful tool that can be used to unlock insights and drive better decision-making in a wide range of industries. With its ability to reveal patterns and relationships in data, GIS mapping is a valuable tool for urban planning, natural resource management, and much more. By getting started with GIS mapping, you can begin to explore the potential of this technology and unlock the secrets of your data.</p>",

Open source GIS software can be run on a variety of operating systems, whereas proprietary systems are only available for one or two operating systems. Open source systems often have similar functionality and quality to proprietary products.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Software is Free and Does Not Have Restrictions on Use or Redistribution.</h2>\n<p>It can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications, without paying any fees to the author or copyright holder. Additionally, open source GIS software can be modified and redistributed as it is under a license that permits this type of activity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of free GIS software isn't new; Esri was founded in 1969 specifically to develop and distribute such products after finding that many customers were using public domain systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, many modern GIS technologies are built on top of open source code such as PostgreSQL or MySQL databases—both of which provide their source code freely as well.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Means That the Original Source Code is Available for Users to Modify and Adapt to Suit Their Needs.</h2>\n<p>Open source software is free to use. It allows you to see the source code, modify it and adapt it to suit your needs. You can also share and redistribute open source software with others. </p>\n<p>If you want to distribute a modified version of an open source program, you may do so as long as you comply with both the terms of the license that covers your use of the original program and any other applicable law in doing so (e.g., fair use). The most common form of open-source software license is known as “copyleft” licensing which requires those who distribute modified versions of copyrighted works based on copylefted material must make their modifications available under similar terms for others receiving such a copy or derivative work from them; however, certain licenses are permissive in allowing redistribution without this requirement if reproduced on another medium or if distributed with an accompanying text file containing information required by law (such as copyrights).</p>\n<h2>GIS Allows Users to Map Out Data, Analyze it, and Share the Results.</h2>\n<p>GIS alongside open-source programming languages allows users to map out data, analyze it, and share the results. GIS programs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as mapping crime rates across cities or determining whether certain areas have adequate access to fresh water. These applications are often very specific in nature and require highly skilled programmers to create them—therefore making GIS software proprietary software is not financially feasible for most companies who would benefit from its use. </p>\n<p>Open source GIS programs provide a solution by allowing anyone with access to the internet or a computer running Windows OS or Mac OS X operating systems with an internet connection to use these powerful tools at no cost.</p>\n<h2>Proprietary GIS Software is Expensive</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software is free and doesn’t require you to pay any licensing fees. Proprietary GIS software, on the other hand, requires payment of licensing fees. One of the main advantages of open source GIS software is that it can be freely used, modified, and redistributed with no limitation or restriction. This allows users to customize the program as they see fit. Open source GIS also aid in collaboration because multiple people can work on the same projects at once without having to share files back and forth.</p>\n<h2>Open Source GIS Can Do the Same Work as Proprietary GIS but Without Additional Costs.</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software often has similar capabilities as proprietary GIS programs but you don't have to pay any money upfront or per use. For example, an open source version of ArcGIS called <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/qgis-free-open-source-cross-platform-gis.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>QGIS</strong></span></a> performs nearly identically to ArcMap and does not cost anything and can be installed on as many computers as you want. Anyone with access to the internet and a modern computer can download and install QGIS.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software is an incredibly powerful tool, and it can do the same work as proprietary GIS. However, open source won't cost you anything to use or manage. You can download and install open source programs for free without paying any license fees to a vendor. Open source GIS software is an alternative to proprietary GIS software. This means that it can do the same work as proprietary GIS but without additional costs. Open source GIS also allows users to modify and adapt it to suit their needs, which makes it useful for many different applications.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When you think of a geographic information system (GIS), you probably think of maps, charts and other visualizations. But there's more to GIS than just imagery—it can also be used as a tool for data discovery. In this post, we'll discuss how to unlock the potential of open federal, state and local GIS data by uncovering free federal data resources, exploring free state and local sources and learning how best to use them all together. </p>\n<h2>Uncovering Free Federal Data Resources </h2>\n<p>There is a wealth of open source GIS data available that can help with your work. Federal agencies are required to make their data open and accessible. Some of the best sources for open federal, state and local GIS data can be found open and available online in a format easy to view and download for processing. The following list highlights some federal, state and local sources of open GIS data and tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/united-states-geological-survey-usgs.html\">USGS (United States Geological Survey)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration-noaa.html\">NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/environmental-protection-agency-list-of-gis-rest-services.html\">EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The federal, state and local governments all make available a wide variety of spatial data (that is, information that has a location associated with it). To help you find this valuable resource, the US government maintains an open data portal at www.data.gov that allows users to search for and download geospatial datasets from across the country. The site also offers links to other important resources such as the National Geospatial Program (NGP) and National Map Viewer. </p>\n<h2>Tips for Using Open Source GIS Data</h2>\n<p>Know your data. Before you use open source GIS data in your project, take the time to understand the data and its limitations. Understanding the source of the data will help you determine what is and isn't a good candidate for your project, as well as how it can be used (or if it should even be used at all). While many open source datasets have metadata attached that describes their origin and quality, this information may not always be available or easy to find.</p>\n<p>Understand copyright restrictions. Just because a dataset is made publicly available doesn't mean that anyone can do whatever they want with it immediately! You'll always want to pay attention to any copyright statements or licenses associated with an open source dataset before using it in your project. Be aware of whether there are any restrictions on how much money you can charge for any products created using their information, how many people are allowed access at once (with limits on concurrent users), whether commercial companies need additional licensing agreements before they use certain materials from these datasets, etcetera—these kinds of things exist within most of today's licenses governing digital content creation - so make sure they're not being overlooked while planning out future projects involving GIS software/data sets! </p>",

Urban planners and developers use GIS to outline zones where certain types of buildings and amenities will be placed in cities and neighborhoods. The military uses GIS to plan missions and monitor situations like movements of troops and equipment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5\">What data can be used in a GIS?</h2>\n<p class=\"fs-5 mb-4\">A GIS requires spatial data, or data that is tied to a specific location on Earth. Satellite data is often the first type of data that comes to mind when thinking about GIS. Using satellite data users are able to see what the world looks like the time the images where captured and how it may have changed if there were previous images taken. Polygon data is often used to show country, state, city and municipal boundaries. A line might be used to show a road or a river. A single point or a collection of points might be used to show where events happened or where something is located.</p>",

My next course of action is to add the federal sources and the other miscellaneous sources. All of the sources from the API and the list are GIS rest servers. The initial sources published on this website were Geo Portals or geospatial data search engines for different organizations within states. The plan is to integrate the API for the rest servers and continue to add Geo Portals and other miscellaneous sources that are not just rest servers.
