            "content_html": "<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Geographic information systems (GIS) is a series of computer programs that link geographic features in a database with information about them. This allows users to map out data, analyze it, and share the results. The use of open source GIS software can save companies money and allow greater flexibility than proprietary GIS systems do. </p>\n<h2>Open Source GIS Software is an Alternative to Proprietary GIS Software.</h2>\n<p>Proprietary GIS software is expensive, whereas open source GIS software is free. Open source GIS software can be run on a variety of operating systems, whereas proprietary systems are only available for one or two operating systems. Open source systems often have similar functionality and quality to proprietary products.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Software is Free and Does Not Have Restrictions on Use or Redistribution.</h2>\n<p>It can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications, without paying any fees to the author or copyright holder. Additionally, open source GIS software can be modified and redistributed as it is under a license that permits this type of activity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of free GIS software isn't new; Esri was founded in 1969 specifically to develop and distribute such products after finding that many customers were using public domain systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, many modern GIS technologies are built on top of open source code such as PostgreSQL or MySQL databases—both of which provide their source code freely as well.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Means That the Original Source Code is Available for Users to Modify and Adapt to Suit Their Needs.</h2>\n<p>Open source software is free to use. It allows you to see the source code, modify it and adapt it to suit your needs. You can also share and redistribute open source software with others. </p>\n<p>If you want to distribute a modified version of an open source program, you may do so as long as you comply with both the terms of the license that covers your use of the original program and any other applicable law in doing so (e.g., fair use). The most common form of open-source software license is known as “copyleft” licensing which requires those who distribute modified versions of copyrighted works based on copylefted material must make their modifications available under similar terms for others receiving such a copy or derivative work from them; however, certain licenses are permissive in allowing redistribution without this requirement if reproduced on another medium or if distributed with an accompanying text file containing information required by law (such as copyrights).</p>\n<h2>GIS Allows Users to Map Out Data, Analyze it, and Share the Results.</h2>\n<p>GIS alongside open-source programming languages allows users to map out data, analyze it, and share the results. GIS programs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as mapping crime rates across cities or determining whether certain areas have adequate access to fresh water. These applications are often very specific in nature and require highly skilled programmers to create them—therefore making GIS software proprietary software is not financially feasible for most companies who would benefit from its use. </p>\n<p>Open source GIS programs provide a solution by allowing anyone with access to the internet or a computer running Windows OS or Mac OS X operating systems with an internet connection to use these powerful tools at no cost.</p>\n<h2>Proprietary GIS Software is Expensive</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software is free and doesn’t require you to pay any licensing fees. Proprietary GIS software, on the other hand, requires payment of licensing fees. One of the main advantages of open source GIS software is that it can be freely used, modified, and redistributed with no limitation or restriction. This allows users to customize the program as they see fit. Open source GIS also aid in collaboration because multiple people can work on the same projects at once without having to share files back and forth.</p>\n<h2>Open Source GIS Can Do the Same Work as Proprietary GIS but Without Additional Costs.</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software often has similar capabilities as proprietary GIS programs but you don't have to pay any money upfront or per use. For example, an open source version of ArcGIS called QGIS performs nearly identically to ArcMap and does not cost anything and can be installed on as many computers as you want. Anyone with access to the internet and a modern computer can download and install QGIS.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Open source GIS software is an incredibly powerful tool, and it can do the same work as proprietary GIS. However, open source won't cost you anything to use or manage. You can download and install open source programs for free without paying any license fees to a vendor. Open source GIS software is an alternative to proprietary GIS software. This means that it can do the same work as proprietary GIS but without additional costs. Open source GIS also allows users to modify and adapt it to suit their needs, which makes it useful for many different applications.</p>",

But there's more to GIS than just imagery—it can also be used as a tool for data discovery. In this post, we'll discuss how to unlock the potential of open federal, state and local GIS data by uncovering free federal data resources, exploring free state and local sources and learning how best to use them all together. </p>\n<h2>Uncovering Free Federal Data Resources </h2>\n<p>There is a wealth of open source GIS data available that can help with your work. Federal agencies are required to make their data open and accessible. Some of the best sources for open federal, state and local GIS data can be found open and available online in a format easy to view and download for processing. The following list highlights some federal, state and local sources of open GIS data and tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>USGS (United States Geological Survey)</li>\n<li>NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)</li>\n<li>EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The federal, state and local governments all make available a wide variety of spatial data (that is, information that has a location associated with it). To help you find this valuable resource, the US government maintains an open data portal at www.data.gov that allows users to search for and download geospatial datasets from across the country. The site also offers links to other important resources such as the National Geospatial Program (NGP) and National Map Viewer. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Tips for Using Open Source GIS Data</h2>\n<p>Know your data. Before you use open source GIS data in your project, take the time to understand the data and its limitations. Understanding the source of the data will help you determine what is and isn't a good candidate for your project, as well as how it can be used (or if it should even be used at all). While many open source datasets have metadata attached that describes their origin and quality, this information may not always be available or easy to find.</p>\n<p>Understand copyright restrictions. Just because a dataset is made publicly available doesn't mean that anyone can do whatever they want with it immediately! You'll always want to pay attention to any copyright statements or licenses associated with an open source dataset before using it in your project. Be aware of whether there are any restrictions on how much money you can charge for any products created using their information, how many people are allowed access at once (with limits on concurrent users), whether commercial companies need additional licensing agreements before they use certain materials from these datasets, etcetera—these kinds of things exist within most of today's licenses governing digital content creation - so make sure they're not being overlooked while planning out future projects involving GIS software/data sets! </p>",

A GIS holds different types of geospatial data types like rasters, points, lines and polygons for visualization and analysis. The technology of visualizing and analyzing geographic data can be applied to any industry and add value.</p>\n<h2>What is GIS used for?</h2>\n<p>GIS can be used to identify problems, monitor changes, manage and respond to events, perform forecasting, set priorities and to understand trends. GIS is used in many different industries including but not limited to environmental, emergency, urban planning, real estate, government, military, agriculture and many more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Snow-cholera-map.jpg\" alt=\"The original map drawn by Dr. John Snow (1813-1858), a British physician who is one of the founders of medical epidemiology, showing cases of cholera in the London epidemics of 1854, clustered around the locations of water pumps.\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p>The original map drawn by Dr. John Snow (1813-1858), a British physician who is one of the founders of medical epidemiology, showing cases of cholera in the London epidemics of 1854, clustered around the locations of water pumps. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Wikimedia Commons Public Domain Image</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5\">Examples of GIS uses in different industries</h2>\n<p class=\"fs-5 mb-4\">Real estate agents use a GIS to visualize average home prices across different areas. Urban planners and developers use GIS to outline zones where certain types of buildings and amenities will be placed in cities and neighborhoods. The military uses GIS to plan missions and monitor situations like movements of troops and equipment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5\">What data can be used in a GIS?</h2>\n<p class=\"fs-5 mb-4\">A GIS requires spatial data, or data that is tied to a specific location on Earth. Satellite data is often the first type of data that comes to mind when thinking about GIS. Using satellite data users are able to see what the world looks like the time the images where captured and how it may have changed if there were previous images taken. Polygon data is often used to show country, state, city and municipal boundaries. A line might be used to show a road or a river. A single point or a collection of points might be used to show where events happened or where something is located.</p>",

He was inspired to create the application by Jeff from mappingsupport.com who created and maintains a very large list of GIS rest servers. The application provides an interface to interact with the list by creating pages for the different categories. There is a State category, a category US Federal sources and another category for miscellaneous sources.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5\">Special Thanks to Ben</h2>\n<p class=\"fs-5 mb-4\">I want to give a special thanks to Ben Millard for creating this application and the API that serves the data. After posting on Reddit about the Open Source GIS Data State Index he reached out giving me permission to use the API. I was able to create a short vanilla javascipt script that fetches data from his API and displays it on the <a href=\"https://opensourcegisdata.com/state/index.html\">state pages.</a> This allowed me to easily add hundreds of GIS rest servers to the website for every single state.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5\">Plans for the future</h2>\n<p class=\"fs-5 mb-4\">At the time of posting this article I have not yet integrated the Federal data sources from the API in the website. My next course of action is to add the federal sources and the other miscellaneous sources. All of the sources from the API and the list are GIS rest servers. The initial sources published on this website were Geo Portals or geospatial data search engines for different organizations within states. The plan is to integrate the API for the rest servers and continue to add Geo Portals and other miscellaneous sources that are not just rest servers. Beyond just finding and adding sources I will create content around some of the most useful and interesting resources that are recommended to me or that I find.</p>",
