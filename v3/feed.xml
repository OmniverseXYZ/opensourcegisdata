                <h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">What is landcover classification</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The Earth's surface is a complex environment, and land cover classification helps us understand it. Landcover classifiers use <em><strong><a href="https://opensourcegisdata.com/what-is-a-geographic-information-system.html">geographic information systems (GIS)</a> </strong></em>or satellite imagery to classify land according to its properties. They can then examine the patterns they find to see how human activity has changed over time or predict how it will change in the future.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classification is the process of assigning categories to land based on its characteristics.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Land cover classifiers use geographic information systems (GIS) or satellite imagery to classify land according to its properties, such as whether it is grassland, forest or wetland. This data can help us understand how our planet's surfaces are changing over time and how we might use that information for future planning purposes.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The following layers come from the<strong> <em><a href="https://maps.coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/FloodExposureMapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FloodExposureMapper Service from NOAA</a>.</em></strong> LandCover Natural Areas Open Space has three different classifications represented by tan, light green and green. This classification identifies different types of natural areas and where they occur along the coast lines of the United States. The second layer used is the LandCover Developed which has four different classifications for urban development ranging from low to high intensity development. The development classifications as represented using a gray scale that gets darker with high degrees of development. </p>

<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classification is used in a variety of fields, including earth science, agriculture, and urban planning.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">There are several different types of landcover classification schemes. The most common type classifies land according to the dominant types of vegetation occurring on it. This type is often called plant communities or floristic community maps because it maps plant species (flora) rather than taxa (animals).</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classifiers use geographic information systems (GIS) or satellite imagery to classify land according to its properties. They are used for mapping, analysis and decision-making. Landcover classification is also called land cover mapping, or thematic mapping of vegetative cover types. It can be done by hand or automated methods such as image classification.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">When using background satellite imagery courtsey of the<strong> <em><a href="https://cimsgeo.coastal.louisiana.gov/arcgis/rest/services/image_services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Louisiana Coastal REST Service directory for imagery</a></em></strong> combined with our previous land cover data we will observe that the dark green areas represent land that is covered in trees while the light green is open farmlands. The classification layers also acurately describes ares with roads and urban development which are represented in grey colors on the map. </p>

<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classification helps us understand the Earth's surface.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classification classifies land cover (the type of vegetation) into categories such as forest or grassland. It can help us understand how much of the Earth's surface is covered by different types of vegetation as well as how ecosystems are changing over time.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Landcover classification is a powerful tool for understanding the Earth’s surface. It allows us to identify areas with particular characteristics and use this information in a variety of applications.

                <p class="msg msg--highlight ">Geographic information systems (GIS) is a series of computer programs that link geographic features in a database with information about them. This allows users to map out data, analyze it, and share the results. The use of open source GIS software can save companies money and allow greater flexibility than proprietary GIS systems do. </p>
<h2>Open Source GIS Software is an Alternative to Proprietary GIS Software.</h2>
<p>Proprietary GIS software is expensive, whereas open source GIS software is free. Open source GIS software can be run on a variety of operating systems, whereas proprietary systems are only available for one or two operating systems. Open source systems often have similar functionality and quality to proprietary products.</p>
<h2>Open Source Software is Free and Does Not Have Restrictions on Use or Redistribution.</h2>
<p>It can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications, without paying any fees to the author or copyright holder. Additionally, open source GIS software can be modified and redistributed as it is under a license that permits this type of activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of free GIS software isn't new; Esri was founded in 1969 specifically to develop and distribute such products after finding that many customers were using public domain systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, many modern GIS technologies are built on top of open source code such as PostgreSQL or MySQL databases—both of which provide their source code freely as well.</p>
<h2>Open Source Means That the Original Source Code is Available for Users to Modify and Adapt to Suit Their Needs.</h2>
<p>Open source software is free to use. It allows you to see the source code, modify it and adapt it to suit your needs. You can also share and redistribute open source software with others. </p>
<p>If you want to distribute a modified version of an open source program, you may do so as long as you comply with both the terms of the license that covers your use of the original program and any other applicable law in doing so (e.g., fair use). The most common form of open-source software license is known as “copyleft” licensing which requires those who distribute modified versions of copyrighted works based on copylefted material must make their modifications available under similar terms for others receiving such a copy or derivative work from them; however, certain licenses are permissive in allowing redistribution without this requirement if reproduced on another medium or if distributed with an accompanying text file containing information required by law (such as copyrights).</p>
<h2>GIS Allows Users to Map Out Data, Analyze it, and Share the Results.</h2>
<p>GIS alongside open-source programming languages allows users to map out data, analyze it, and share the results. GIS programs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as mapping crime rates across cities or determining whether certain areas have adequate access to fresh water. These applications are often very specific in nature and require highly skilled programmers to create them—therefore making GIS software proprietary software is not financially feasible for most companies who would benefit from its use. </p>
<p>Open source GIS programs provide a solution by allowing anyone with access to the internet or a computer running Windows OS or Mac OS X operating systems with an internet connection to use these powerful tools at no cost.</p>
<h2>Proprietary GIS Software is Expensive</h2>
<p>Open source GIS software is free and doesn’t require you to pay any licensing fees. Proprietary GIS software, on the other hand, requires payment of licensing fees. One of the main advantages of open source GIS software is that it can be freely used, modified, and redistributed with no limitation or restriction. This allows users to customize the program as they see fit. Open source GIS also aid in collaboration because multiple people can work on the same projects at once without having to share files back and forth.</p>
<h2>Open Source GIS Can Do the Same Work as Proprietary GIS but Without Additional Costs.</h2>
<p>Open source GIS software often has similar capabilities as proprietary GIS programs but you don't have to pay any money upfront or per use. For example, an open source version of ArcGIS called QGIS performs nearly identically to ArcMap and does not cost anything and can be installed on as many computers as you want. Anyone with access to the internet and a modern computer can download and install QGIS.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Open source GIS software is an incredibly powerful tool, and it can do the same work as proprietary GIS. However, open source won't cost you anything to use or manage. You can download and install open source programs for free without paying any license fees to a vendor. Open source GIS software is an alternative to proprietary GIS software. This means that it can do the same work as proprietary GIS but without additional costs. Open source GIS also allows users to modify and adapt it to suit their needs, which makes it useful for many different applications.</p>

                <p>When you think of a geographic information system (GIS), you probably think of maps, charts and other visualizations. But there's more to GIS than just imagery—it can also be used as a tool for data discovery. In this post, we'll discuss how to unlock the potential of open federal, state and local GIS data by uncovering free federal data resources, exploring free state and local sources and learning how best to use them all together. </p>
<h2>Uncovering Free Federal Data Resources </h2>
<p>There is a wealth of open source GIS data available that can help with your work. Federal agencies are required to make their data open and accessible. Some of the best sources for open federal, state and local GIS data can be found open and available online in a format easy to view and download for processing. The following list highlights some federal, state and local sources of open GIS data and tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://opensourcegisdata.com/united-states-geological-survey-usgs.html">USGS (United States Geological Survey)</a></strong></li>
<li>NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)</li>
<li>EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)</li>
</ul>
<p>The federal, state and local governments all make available a wide variety of spatial data (that is, information that has a location associated with it). To help you find this valuable resource, the US government maintains an open data portal at www.data.gov that allows users to search for and download geospatial datasets from across the country. The site also offers links to other important resources such as the National Geospatial Program (NGP) and National Map Viewer. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Tips for Using Open Source GIS Data</h2>
<p>Know your data. Before you use open source GIS data in your project, take the time to understand the data and its limitations. Understanding the source of the data will help you determine what is and isn't a good candidate for your project, as well as how it can be used (or if it should even be used at all). While many open source datasets have metadata attached that describes their origin and quality, this information may not always be available or easy to find.</p>
<p>Understand copyright restrictions. Just because a dataset is made publicly available doesn't mean that anyone can do whatever they want with it immediately! You'll always want to pay attention to any copyright statements or licenses associated with an open source dataset before using it in your project. Be aware of whether there are any restrictions on how much money you can charge for any products created using their information, how many people are allowed access at once (with limits on concurrent users), whether commercial companies need additional licensing agreements before they use certain materials from these datasets, etcetera—these kinds of things exist within most of today's licenses governing digital content creation - so make sure they're not being overlooked while planning out future projects involving GIS software/data sets! </p>
